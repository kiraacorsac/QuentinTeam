Best I can do are 4 lines:
Roses are red,
My screen is blue,
I think I just deleted,
System_32.

I do  need it somehow
nor color of roses is in my head
freedom seems to be far away
all flowers will be dead.
This is the 5th verse that I do not need

To keep your marriage brimming
With love in the loving cup,
Whenever you’re wrong, admit it;
Whenever you’re right, shut up.
That's how you survive ;) (Helmut)

Are you alive?
I touch you.
You quiver like a sea-fish.
I cover you with my net.
What are you—banded one?

4 or 5 does not matter
when all roses die 
and all hope seems lost
freedom lives inside us
that's my vir us 

Oh oh guys
What a sweet surprise
Is this still python?
I'll just put this verse on
Oh, where is the submit icon?

This is indeed still python
sneaking on us from behind the visual code and github icon
just like my kids when I'm on a conference call
the needy snake will eventually get the attention of us all
so just embrace yourselves and continue with dr Chuck...!

It has gained popularity
With lots of notoriety
Even person is named python for such quality
As it has some similarity 
It moves in jungle freely with no fear
