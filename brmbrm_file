Best I can do are 4 lines:
Roses are red,
My screen is blue,
I think I just deteled,
System_32.

I do not need it anyway
nor color of roses is in my head
freedom seems to be far away
all flowers will be dead.
This is the 5th verse that I do not need

To keep your marriage brimming
With love in the loving cup,
Whenever you’re wrong, admit it;
Whenever you’re right, shut up.
That's how you survive ;) (Helmut)

Are you alive?
I touch you.
You quiver like a sea-fish.
I cover you with my net.
What are you—banded one?

4 or 5 does not matter
when all roses die 
and all hope seems lost
freedom lives inside us
that's my vir us 

Oh oh guys
What a sweet surprise
Is this still python?
I'll just put this verse on
Oh, where is the submit icon?
