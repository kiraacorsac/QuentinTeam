Best I can do are 4 lines:
Roses are red,
My screen is blue,
I think I'll just deal drugs
and kill System_32.

I do not need it anyway
nor color of roses is in my head
freedom and life seems to be far away
all flowers will be dead.
This is the 5th catastrophic verse that I do not need

To keep your marriage brimming
have your knife sharp and shining,
Whenever you’re wrong, stay ready;
Whenever you’re right, hold your gun steady.
That's how you survive ;) (Helmut)

Are you undead?
I touch you with my teeth.
You quiver like a pig-head.
I cover you with my rotten meat.
What are you—contagious one?

does not matter, 4 or 5 
and all hopes seem to be lost,
when all roses go to die 
freedom so dies inside us
our only survivor is the vir-us 

Ho ho guys
What a sweet optimistic surprise
Is this still python?
No idea, I think you need meds
Oh, where is the self destruction icon?

This indeed, is still a python
sneaking on us from behind the visual code and github falcon
just like my kids when I am down in the hall
the needy snake will eventually get us all
so just embrace yourselves and go on!

It has gained popularity
With lots of sobriety
Even person is named Johnnie Walker for such purity
As he has some level of mortality 
It moves in a jungle sneaking for it's prey
covering in a shade to find out it's the lord's last day
