Best Verse is 4 lines:
Roses are red,
MY screen is blue,
I think i just deleted,
System_32.
=======
A sombre wind
has been sweepin'
Through pandemic of Covid19
Hungry, raking
Caught us all in face masks making 

Best I can do are 4 lines:
Roses are pink,
My screen is blue,
I think I'll just deal drugs
and kill System_52.

I do not need it anyway
nor color of roses is in my head
<<<<<<< HEAD
freedom seems to be far away
all coronas will be dead.
This is the 5th verse that I do not need 

To keep your marriage brimming
With love in the loving cup,
Whenever you’re wrong, admit it;
Whenever you’re right, shut up.
That's how you survive ;) (Helmutko)

Are you alive?
I kiss you.
You quiver like a sea-fish.
I cover you with my net.
What are you—banded one?

4 or 5 does not matter
when all roses die 
and all hope seems lost
freedom lives inside us
that's my vir us 

Oh oh guys
What a sweet surprise

freedom and life seems to be far away
all flowers will be dead.
This is the 5th catastrophic verse that I do not need

To keep your marriage brimming
have your knife sharp and shining,
Whenever you’re wrong, stay ready;
Whenever you’re right, hold your gun steady.
Helmut, really?

Are you undead?
I touch you softly with my script.
And you still quiver like a pig-head.
I cover you with my rotten list.
That's all I need you to iterate

does not matter, 4 or 5 
I don't see here any rhyme
now all verses seem to be lost,
Quentin, you're like a ghost
that's what Pooky likes the most 

Ho ho guys
What a sweet optimistic surprise
Is this still python?
No idea, I think you need meds
Oh, where is the self destruction icon?

This indeed, is still a python
sneaking on us from behind the visual code and github falcon
just like my kids when I am down in the hall
the needy snake will eventually get us all
so just embrace yourselves and go on!

It has gained popularity
With lots of sobriety
Even person is named Johnnie Walker for such purity
As he has some level of mortality 
It moves in a jungle sneaking for it's prey
covering in a shade to find out it's the lord's last day
